                 Who is Rodolfo Martinez Medina?  The Man. The Myth. The legend. Rodolfo is the last person you will ever have to meet
                 for the rest of your life. The man has jokes, charisma and a heavy dose of sarcasm.
                 His hoobies include playing music, specially the drums. He also plays videogames, does video and photo editing, and reads 
                 in his free time. 
                 <br>
                 If you ever ask him what his favorite videogame is, he will quickly respond with "Silent Hill 2, because of its masterful 
                 portrayal of deep themes through psychological horror."
                 If you ever ask him what his favorite band is, he will probably respond with "Eh, I dunno, I'm a big fan of Pink Floyd but
                 lately I have been listening to a lot of Indie Rock."
                 <br>
                 In summation, Rodolfo Martinez Medina is a person you should talk to.
